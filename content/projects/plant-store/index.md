This is my first website I coded from scratch and I must say I am pretty proud of it. 

This is a school assigment and it only had to be one page website but I just could not help myslef and did couple pages, as I was just learning on how everything worked I did not make this a mobile friendly and I have thought about opening it up again in my code editor and do it responsive but I decided not to. I will just keep it "raw" and untouched :)
