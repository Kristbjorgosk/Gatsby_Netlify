# My Portfolio / blog website

I made this site with Gatsby, graphql and Netlify cms.

This site is still a work in process..

I started by installing the [gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) but deleted all the styles and css that came with it and made my own style.css file.

I connected to Netlify cms and added some new "collection" in the config.yml file, I added "projects" and "about me" so I can update that and add new via the cms.

The contact form is through Netlify form and the emails are sent to my Netlify account and I can get a notification in my email once someone contact me

It was a bit of a challenge to learn graphql as that is the magic behind the Gatsby static site and its speed to get data. But I think it is worth it learning it and it is pretty easy once you get it (like everything ðŸ¤ª)

What I am going to do in the next weeks is: make a frontpage, make the projects clickable so you can read in details about each project (and add more) and well, write something about me.

Here it is:
